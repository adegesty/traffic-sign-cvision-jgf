Hi all,

the project you propose sounds nice and with
some performance evaluation suitable for a
group of three people. You are free to use the
programming language you want.

It's probably a good idea to divide the
whole project into smaller parts like:

Detect traffic sign candidates:
  Color-Segmentation/Extraction of sign-candidates
  (With 3 people you could explore 2-3 different Segmentation methods and
   determine which seems to be more suitable for the task)
Rough sign classification:
Shape-analysis of the candidates
  -> maybe focus to distinguish 2-3 shapes? i.e. round/ triangular/ rectangular
Performance evaluation:
Explore a few different shape descriptors Do tests on real-world images and evaluate when it works well and
when and why the proposed method fails sometimes.

This already seems have a project-size worth of up to 30 points ...
but you are free to analyze the signs further to figure out
what number might be on a round (speed limit) sign.

best regards
